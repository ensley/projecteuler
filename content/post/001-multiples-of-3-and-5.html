<div id="problem" class="section level1">
<h1><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1">Problem</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>

<div id="explanation" class="section level1">
<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p>We start out with an easy one. There are a ton of different ways to get the correct sum. Since R is so <a href="http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/4/16/vectorization-in-r--why.html">vectorized</a>, I feel like the most R-like way is to avoid any loops and deal with vectors instead.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the list of numbers that make up our target sum:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, 33
\]</span></p>
<p>All multiples of 3 appear in the list, so the first step is to add up all multiples of 3 from 1 to 1000. All multiples of 5 also appear in the list, so we can add all of those from 1 to 1000 as well. However, if we add these sums together, we will have included 15, 30, 45, … twice. To account for this, we can simply sum up all multiples of 15 from 1 to 1000, and subtract that sum.</p>

<div id="implementation" class="section level1">
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>problem1 &lt;- function(n) {
  sum_3 &lt;- sum(seq(0, n-1, by = 3))
  sum_5 &lt;- sum(seq(0, n-1, by = 5))
  sum_15 &lt;- sum(seq(0, n-1, by = 15))
  
  sum_3 + sum_5 - sum_15
}</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>problem1(1000)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 233168</code></pre>
<p>If you got 234168, you probably missed the “BELOW 1000” part of the problem statement. Even though 1000 is a multiple of 5, it should not be included in the sum.</p>

<div id="timing" class="section level1">
<h1>Timing</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>( m &lt;- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(p1 = problem1(1000), unit = &#39;ms&#39;) )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Unit: milliseconds
##  expr      min        lq      mean    median        uq      max neval
##    p1 0.034683 0.0354675 0.1791402 0.0358245 0.0364005 14.29492   100</code></pre>
<p>The solution takes about 0.04 milliseconds.</p>
