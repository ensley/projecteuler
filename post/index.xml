      <description>Problem  The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
  Explanation Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be represented as the product of prime numbers. ⊕That’s the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. The most straightforward approach for solving this problem is to simply walk through the prime numbers less than \(n = 600851475143\) and try dividing each of them into \(n\).</description>

      <description>Problem  Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
  Explanation The naive approach works just fine here.</description>

      <title>Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5</title>

      <description>Problem  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
  Explanation We start out with an easy one. There are a ton of different ways to get the correct sum. Since R is so vectorized, I feel like the most R-like way is to avoid any loops and deal with vectors instead.</description>
