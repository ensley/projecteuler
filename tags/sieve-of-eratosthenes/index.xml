      <description>Problem  By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?
  Explanation We’ve already implemented the sieve of Eratosthenes, a method for generating all primes less than some \(n\). In order to use that, we’ll need to know some value of \(n\) such that there will be at least 10,001 prime numbers less than \(n\).</description>

      <description>Problem  The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
  Explanation Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be represented as the product of prime numbers. ⊕That’s the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. The most straightforward approach for solving this problem is to simply walk through the prime numbers less than \(n = 600851475143\) and try dividing each of them into \(n\).</description>
